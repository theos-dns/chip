# Theos DNS Chip 

## Goal
This project is aim to bypass DNS-hijacking in countries like Iran, by converting regular DNS query's to https and ask our custom server(for example [blocky](https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky))

## Features
using single portable device [`ESP32`](https://www.google.com/search?q=esp32) as a client in ur network instead of `Router` to fix this problems

 - can be set on console like `playstation` and `xbox`
 - can use maximum Internet Speed, `FTTH` or etc. because it's just a client in network, not a router
 - can work even on Hotspot network share
 - can be power on just by connecting to Phone USB-C port
 - async request and response(can handle multiple request at once)
 - it is very, very cheap. just under `4$` :)
